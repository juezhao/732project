# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

实现一个web项目——外卖网站，网站前端必须使用react实现，后端可以用自己熟悉的技术实现。
餐馆老板可以注册并列出他们的食物，以及描述、照片和价格。
顾客还可以注册、查看附近的餐厅、他们的食物，以及从任何选定的餐厅订购食物。
餐厅应接受订单，并指定送货员。
必须向订购食品的用户显示订单号、订单状态、送货人员的位置和预计送货时间（ETD）。
食品交付时，订单状态应相应更新。
系统为每个用户维护过去订单的列表。
当餐厅更新菜单或提供新服务时，网站可以向用户发送通知提醒。
当餐厅注册该系统时，管理人员应验证并批准其请求。
管理员可以拒绝或批准来自新餐厅的请求，而且只有在餐厅获得批准后才能上架对应的菜品。
网站不需要实现支付系统。
